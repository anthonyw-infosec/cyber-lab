# ‚úÖ Lab Summary: Secure Azure Storage with RBAC & Key Vault

## What I Did:
- Created a Storage Account in the Azure sandbox environment
- Assigned appropriate roles to limit access (e.g., Storage Blob Data Reader)
- Created a Key Vault and generated an encryption key
- Enabled encryption using the Key Vault-managed key

## What I Learned:
- How RBAC works in Azure (least privilege = üîê)
- Importance of separating access control and key management
- Azure's built-in encryption options for storage

## Tools Used:
- Azure Portal (Microsoft Learn Sandbox)
- Key Vault
- IAM / Role Assignments
